I stood in the historic Dallas County Commissioners Court chamber, microphone trembling slightly in my hand, surrounded by judges, commissioners, advocates, and fellow refugees. Thirty years earlier, I was a barefoot child in Gihembe Refugee Camp who had never seen a real courtroom. Now, I was invited to speak on the very day Dallas County would sign a resolution officially recognizing June 20 as International World Refugee Day."

        text: "When my name was called, I felt the weight of millions of displaced souls on my shoulders. I spoke of fleeing war-torn Congo as a small boy, of nights filled with gunfire, of losing family members to violence the world barely noticed. I told them about arriving in Rwanda with nothing but the clothes on my back, about growing up believing the world had forgotten us. And then I told them about the day a refugee volunteer handed me a pencil at Hope School – how that single moment rewired my brain to believe a future was possible."

You belong here.' For the first time in my life, a government body looked at refugees and saw potential instead of problems."

This moment belongs not just to me, but to every refugee child who will now grow up knowing that Dallas – and cities like it – see them, value them, and welcome them. This is the world we are building at Engineers4Humanity, one story, one resolution, one open door at a time."
